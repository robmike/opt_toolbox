A basic optimization toolbox written in Matlab as a class project as
an instructional exercise.

Like cryptography getting the details right in computational
optimization is tricky and this library doesn't try to do that. Use an
established library.

Usage
=====
help 'function' should give an explanation of how to use the functions
in this toolbox (where 'function' is the name of function that you need
information for).

testcases.m shows some simple examples of how to use the functions. The
examples are the same as the examples given in the project handout so they
can be used to verify correct operation of the code.
